## �� DESCRIPTION
​
### �� What is it about?
​
By using jQuery, moment.JS and basic HTML and CSS I want to create a work day scheduler which stores the data for each day.  
​
## �� USAGE
​
[**>> Visit my portfolio website <<**](https://github.com/khans0)
​
### �� User story
​
```
As a user with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

​
```
GIVEN workday scheduler
​
WHEN I add a task for the day and click the save button
THEN I will be able to access that same data within that same day
​
WHEN the page loads up it will show me the current time in a differnet colour to the other timings
THEN I easily be able to identify the current time
​

​
```
​
### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
​
It's done when:
​
- [ ]Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
- [ ]Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- [ ]Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed
- [ ]Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
- [ ]Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
- [ ]Persist events between refreshes of a page
